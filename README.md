# PolicyModelsSummary
A script for summarizing [PolicyModels](https://github.com/IQSS/DataTaggingLibrary) interview results.

When running a research using [PolicyModels](https://github.com/IQSS/DataTaggingLibrary), the researchers collect interview 
transcript XML files. This script allows them to translate those files to textual transcripts, and to generate initial overall statistics (tab-separated).
